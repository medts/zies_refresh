   - M1_HOME_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - M1_HOME_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "M2_HOME"   (component BitIO_LDD)
   - M2_HOME_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.
   - M2_HOME_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is read and returned (see <Safe mode> 
                property for limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512LH12)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
